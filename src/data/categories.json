Pierce owns high-end agency Goldman Properties, and he was interested in having Catherine join his team.

But in episode 7 of the freshman drama – which moves to a new Friday at 8 p.m. timeslot starting April 4 – she appears to have decided to strike out on her own. In this exclusive clip from “Germination,” Daisy (Jesica Luza) shows Catherine around the massive house she’s trying to sell. Catherine’s worked with Daisy in the past, having sold her a downtown loft. She’s confident she can get “way over” asking for the luxurious property. But Catherine’s career has stagnated since she left her old agency following her affair with Gary. Daisy is concerned. “You’ve never sold a house without [Gary],” she points out.Enter Pierce, whom Daisy is also considering as a realtor. The realization that her competition is the cocky agent whose job offer she just fumbled puts Catherine on her back foot. At first, Pierce sings Catherine’s praises, calling her a “tremendous realtor.” But he then hints that she won’t be able to give the listing her full attention because of her responsibilities as a mother. “Don’t let her fool you,” he tells Daisy. “She moms so hard, it comes before everything else.” "        },

        "excerpt": "Donald Trump, one of the most powerful and wealthiest men, has a bit of spending habits. From a real estate empire to sentimental purchases like a Muhammad Ali book, here are all of his most expensive purchases.",
      "content1": "Donald Trump is a wealthy man; there’s no doubt about that. According to a recent tally by Forbes, the President’s current net worth stands at $5.1 billion. However, the Republican leader is equally enthusiastic about spending some of his fortune on things he really wants. And why wouldn’t he? The real estate mogul and TV star has successfully established a third career as the two-time President of the United States. He can afford just about anything now. So, what are the most expensive luxury items owned by Donald Trump? Let’s have a look at his spending habits. Donald Trump‘s exquisite car collection is a testament to his wealth, power, and success. He owns some of the world’s most expensive and highest-quality vehicles. However, unlike most car collectors, the President has always prioritized quality over quantity. His garage is filled with the likes of a Mercedes Maybach S600, a 2015 Rolls-Royce Phantom, with a starting price of $500,000, a 2003 Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, which retailed for over  $445,000, a a 2003 Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. However, the most interesting vehicle among his prized possessions is a 1956 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud, which is almost a replica of one of his very first cars.It is no secret that the President is an avid fan of golf. Not only he plays it well but he has also invested heavily in the sport since 1999. However, his investment shows his business acumen alongside his passion for golf. During the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, he entered the market, purchasing many of the 17 gold courses he owns now at a fraction of their actual worth.One of his most notable purchases is the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles, which he purchased for $27 million. Since then, he has invested over $260 million to renovate it as it went bankrupt due to a landslide before he bought the course. Now, it is the most expensive golf course in history. However, his ventures are not limited to the U.S. only, as the Republican leader owns several courses in Dubai, Ireland, and Scotland.",

Inside the master bedroom, there’s also a 24-karat gold sink. However, this expensive jet is not just a symbol of Donald Trump’s extravagant lifestyle. It is also a technical marvel that is equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine, which allows it to exceed 500 miles per hour, and a computerized glass cockpit.Not just private jet, Trump also owns three helicopters: the official White House helicopter Marine One, in addition to Sikorsky S-76 and Cessna Citation X.Long before Trump began eyeing the Oval Office, his career kicked off in real estate back in the 1960s. At his core, he is a true mogul of the business who managed to expand his empire globally. His property investments include major countries like Canada, India, South Korea, the Phillippines, Turkey, Uruguay, and more, in addition to numerous buildings across the U.S. His most notable investment is the Trump Tower, which he purchased for $10 million in 1995. The current value of the 71-story New York City building is disputed, but some put it at $1 billion.Donald Trump shares a special place in my heart for gold. The President is willing to adorn everything with this expensive metal. From cups and plates to his gold-plated Trump Force One sink, his possessions are a testament to his wealth. Even the curtains and furniture he owns have gold lacing!"        },

      "content1": "If you’re going to take a shot at the queen, you’d better not miss.So what does that mean for Tom O’Brien? That’s a head-scratching predicament for one of Boston’s biggest real estate developers, and mayoral-hopeful-for-a-minute.Related: In reversal, developer Thomas O’Brien says he won’t challenge Mayor Wu after allYou may remember how just a week ago this town was abuzz over another challenger wanting to unseat Boston Mayor Michelle Wu in this fall’s election. O’Brien, who long ago served as planning chief under Mayor Tom Menino, would have joined New England Patriots family scion Josh Kraft as a third major candidate for two spots in the November runoff. O’Brien’s primary beef with Wu: She has been hostile to development.O’Brien had planned his campaign launch this week in East Boston, and his imminent entry was front page news on Saturday’s Globe. But by Monday, O’Brien had changed his mind, leaving the rest of us wondering what just happened.Get Starting PointA guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday.Enter EmailSign UpMore importantly for O’Brien’s future as a developer in this town, will the mayor forgive and forget? Or will she view his almost-candidacy the same as taking a shot at her? Boston mayors, Wu included, famously love to hold grudges against those who cross them.AdvertisementTongues are also wagging because O’Brien dropping out has to be a sigh of relief for both Kraft and Wu, albeit for different reasons. To Kraft, O’Brien would been fighting for the same disaffected and anyone-but-Wu voters and courting similar donors in the business community.My sense is that O’Brien was contemplating jumping in so late because he has been unimpressed with Kraft, who is running for office for the first time. Of course, O’Brien is also a political neophyte, but some view him as a more charismatic option with deep roots in community and who might have a better shot at beating Wu.AdvertisementFor Wu, O’Brien would have been another well-funded candidate to fend off, one who’s not tied to a famous billionaire who stirs mixed emotions in Boston. She also couldn’t have liked the prospect of two opponents hammering away at her perceived weaknesses: higher residential property taxes, budget challenges, the inability to build more housing, and her struggle to fix Boston Public Schools.So if both Kraft and Wu had something to gain by O’Brien staying out of the race, did either camp strike a deal to keep him on the sidelines?Mayoral candidate Josh Kraft greets Mayor Michelle Wu before he speaks at the annual St. Patrick’s Day Breakfast in Boston on March 16.",

O’Brien’s HYM Investment Group specializes in complex projects like redeveloping Suffolk Downs and partnering with New Balance on its Boston Landing campus in Allston-Brighton.I know you’re thinking what I’m thinking: So did Robert Kraft give O’Brien a wink and a nod: “Drop out, and I’ll take care of you?”Let’s just say both O’Brien and Kraft camps couldn’t respond fast enough when I asked that question. O’Brien, in a statement, said “no conversations directly or indirectly” have taken place and “nothing like that was a factor in my decision at all.” A Kraft family spokesperson in a statement noted: “Robert Kraft has had no contact with Tom O’Brien in over a decade and has had nothing to do with Tom’s decision to drop out of the Boston mayoral race.”AdvertisementNow the notion that Wu would cut a deal with any developer may seem preposterous, given her track record. But it is worth noting that O’Brien has supported one of her more controversial plans — her bid to increase commercial property taxes. That had some speculating that O’Brien might have jumped in the race to help her, by knocking out Kraft.So why the about-face by O’Brien? After all, he’d begun telling friends he was running before abruptly changing his mind.I have to think after he became front page news, reality caught up fast, and someone delivered him the unvarnished truth: His path to victory would be narrow against an incumbent and a billionaire’s son. One has a track record of whipping up votes in every corner of the city, while the other has access to unlimited funding.And if, as seems likely, O’Brien didn’t win the whole thing, he would be in the unenviable position of angering the current mayor or a future mayor. And in his line of work — where developers need the blessing of the mayor and their appointees for their projects to move forward — being on the wrong side of the mayor can ice you out of City Hall. Just ask Don Chiofaro.My best guess is O’Brien’s investors talked him out of running. O’Brien is inextricably linked to HYM, and a failed mayoral bid could have left the firm branded as a pariah in the city. If the risk was his alone to take, it’s quite likely O’Brien would still be in the race. But I have to think the potential financial fallout to investors, partners, and employees outweighed his own political ambitions.AdvertisementO’Brien still wasn’t ready to jump on the phone with me this week, but in a statement he said his decision “boiled down to the simple fact that the time was not right.”More than anything, O’Brien couldn’t afford to take a shot at the queen and miss. Better to walk away now than lose it all later.Shirley Leung is a Business columnist. "        },

      "content1": "Douglas Higgins, who in middle age returned to a career in education, dies  .March 28, 2025 at 3:17 PM CDTDouglas Higgins spent a quarter-century in real estate management before returning to his roots in education and spending 16 years as the principal and assistant principal of elementary and junior high schools in Bloomingdale, Steger and Calumet City.“He loved the children, and everything that he did was about teaching and learning,” said Anita Rice, the superintendent of Lincoln Elementary School District 156 in Calumet City. “He was deeply committed and he was very thoughtful.”Douglas Higgins (Laurelyn Savannah)Higgins, 81, died of complications from congestive heart failure on Feb. 27 at Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield, said his daughter Rana.Born in Cleveland, Douglas Allen Higgins grew up in Evanston and attended Loyola Academy in Wilmette, where he played baseball and basketball. He received a bachelor’s degree in English from the University of Notre Dame in 1965.After picking up a master’s degree from Notre Dame in 1966, Higgins taught English at Washington High School in South Bend, Indiana, for two years. He substitute taught in Chicago before taking a full-time job in1969 teaching English at Crane Tech High School on the West Side.In the early 1970s, Higgins switched careers and began working in property management for Draper and Kramer real estate, and later with other firms.Then, in 1998, he left real estate and went back to school at National Louis University, earning what then was known as a type 75 certificate — now a professional educator license — to become a school administrator.“He always was passionate about education, and he regretted leaving it,” Higgins’ daughter said. “This was an opportunity for him to change career paths. He was in his 50s at the time and felt very invigorated and didn’t want to retire.” In 1999, Higgins was hired to be an assistant principal at DuJardin Elementary School in Bloomingdale, starting the position at an age, 55, when most teachers and school administrators consider retiring. He was at DuJardin for two years before taking a job as the principal at Central Junior High School in Steger. A year later he became principal at Lincoln Elementary School in Calumet City.“He felt a lot of fulfillment and felt he could really make a difference and really make an impact, and I think working (as a principal) harked back to his days in the Chicago Public Schools,” his daughter said. “He regretted not doing more at that time, so this was his opportunity to make more of an impact.”While at Lincoln, Higgins launched the school’s Tiger Token store and program, as a way to encourage positive and constructive behavior from students. He also initiated the Read to Succeed program and quarterly raffle programs as a way of recognizing pupils who scored 100% on accelerated reading exams.Bonnie Walker, an assistant principal at the school, said Higgins built a strong culture of trust in his staff.",

In addition to his daughter, Higgins is survived by his wife of 30 years, Gabriela; another daughter, Emily; a son, Daniel; two stepdaughters, Banafsheh Siadat and Marwan Siadat; a brother, John; and three grandchildren.Services were held.Goldsborough is a freelance reporter.

Though still off-market, the north tower penthouse is currently priced at $72.5 million while the other, in the south tower, is at $70 million, said Bryan Cho, executive vice president of development at Related Ross, which counts this in its growing West Palm Beach portfolio. The project is slated for completion in early 2027.Cho declined to confirm whether Elon Musk considered one of these penthouses when he reportedly eyed a $100 million condo in West Palm Beach late last year. However, they were the most expensive condos in Palm Beach County as of press time.The duplexes will provide 360-degree views from “a whole collection of outdoor spaces both covered and uncovered,” Cho said, while each of their primary suites will occupy half a floor. “West Palm Beach is becoming a place that has culture and a certain prominence,” said Terra CEO David Martin, adding that Palm Beach development mastermind Stephen Ross lured the Ciprianis to the area. “The new offices, the new educational institutions, everything that’s happening there is trending in a direction that shows their brand is going to do well and be successful.”Guests and residents of the new tower won’t have to go far to access all that glittering “new” — it’s walking distance to the Palm Beach Convention Center and the city’s downtown district. Additional perks include a banquet hall, a library, a spa, a children’s area, business and members-only lounges, plus the prerequisite pool, cabanas and a bar. There’s also in-house dining and catering services and a gym with yoga, Pilates and Peloton studios to work off the nosh. "

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also warned that the levies — which include a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and reciprocal tariffs on nearly 90 countries — are likely to dent the economy. While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, Powell said in a speech Friday in Arlington, Virginia. The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.The S&P 500 fell 322 points, or nearly 6%, to close at 5,074 — the largest one-day slump in the broad-based index since March 16, 2020, when it lost 12%.

That could reduce consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, as well as crimp business investment. Import taxes are largely borne by businesses, which typically pass on part or much of those added costs to consumers. As a result, Americans could face higher prices for electronics, household appliances, cars, clothing, furniture, and food such as coffee and chocolate, according to economists.David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, thinks U.S. trade officials will eventually lower tariff rates as they negotiate with their counterparts abroad. But that process is likely to take time, and the investment bank doesn't expect a speedy reversal in U.S. tariffs. As a result, UBS economists have lowered their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to less than 1%. "          },

Once the poster child for regulatory defiance – Binance was slapped with a record $4.3 billion settlement with regulators and forced to oust billionaire founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao – the crypto exchange is now navigating a dramatically friendlier political landscape under President Donald Trump’s second administration, Teng said.“We’ve benefited from this shift,” said Teng, who was appointed Binance’s CEO in November 2023. Teng’s comments come as the crypto exchange is in talks to have the Trump family take a financial stake in the company, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. That same day, Bloomberg reported that World Liberty Financial, a Trump-linked crypto bank that has not yet launched, is engaged in talks with Binance to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin. If such deals were reached, it would mark a staggering reversal for a company that was once a pariah in Washington. Teng, a soft-spoken former regulator, was careful with his words when addressing the reports.“I believe both World Liberty Financial as well as CZ himself have tweeted and denied the reports,” said Teng, who runs the exchange’s operations outside the U.S. As for the rumors about a Trump stake in Binance.US, Teng demurred. ″.US and .com are quite different animals, right?” he said. “They have different sets of shareholders, different boards of directors, and different CEOs running the show.”",

    "content2": "Zhao, the company’s founder and former CEO, was criminally charged, forced to step down and served a short prison sentence. Binance paid the multibilllion-dollar settlement – finalized in late 2023 – to resolve a raft of violations with U.S. regulators, including the Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.One major front remains open: The Securities and Exchange Commission’s civil case against Binance and Zhao. The SEC and Binance in February agreed to a 60-day pause in proceedings as both sides consider a potential resolution. The stay comes amid a broader pullback by the SEC from several high-profile crypto lawsuits, signaling a potential regulatory reset under the new administration.“We under-invested in compliance in those very early days,” Teng said. “But what’s important as a responsible institution is to acknowledge those early mistakes, make amends for it and invest greatly into compliance, which we are doing now.”Binance now employs more than 1,300 professionals in compliance, roughly a quarter of its total workforce, Teng said. “The direction of travel is very clear. It’s one of compliance.”The Nigerian government might disagree. "

    "content1": "A new malware campaign is rerouting thousands of dollars from cryptocurrency transactions into the accounts of hackers.As reported by The Hacker News, the malware, called MassJacker, is a type of cryware known as clipper malware which is targeting users searching for pirated software online.Instead of the pirated software though, they actually end up downloading clipper malware which is designed to steal cryptocurrency by watching an infected machine’s clipboard and switching out copied cryptocurrency wallet addresses for one controlled by the attackers behind this campaign. According to a new report from CyberArk, the infection chain starts at pesktop[.]com which is a site commonly used to acquire pirated software that also tries to infect systems with multiple types of malware. The initial MassJacker executable acts as a conduit to run a PowerShell script for the Amadey botnet malware and two .NET binaries including one codenamed PackerE.PackerE downloads an encrypted DLL file which then loads a second malicious file that launches the MassJacker payload by injecting it into a legitimate Windows process called InstalUtil.exe. This encrypted DLL incorporates features to evade and avoid analysis including Just-In-Time (JIT) hooking, metadata token mapping, and a custom virtual machine.",

    "content2": "Just like with some other malware strains, getting infected by MassJacker is completely avoidable. As long as you're not downloading pirated software, you should have nothing to worry about at least for now.To keep your devices protected from malware that can slip through the cracks though, you should be using the best antivirus software on your Windows PC or the best Mac antivirus software on your Apple computer. These security programs continually scan all of your existing files and any new ones you try to download for malware.As for keeping your cryptocurrency transactions safe, it might be worth investing in one of the best laptops or even one of the best computers and using that machine solely for crypto. This might sound a bit drastic but by keeping the rest of your online activity separate from your crypto transactions, you can avoid having your funds stolen by malware like MassJacker or by phishing attacks designed to steal your recovery phrase which you should save the old fashioned way on a piece of paper in a secure location as opposed to on your computer or in one of the best password managers.Since recovering lost cryptocurrency is almost impossible, hackers will likely continue to target crypto users online. This is why you need to be extra careful and practice excellent cyber hygiene when dealing with digital currencies."

Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! Certain experts are penciling in a strong rebound for bitcoin heading into summer, after a tough few months for the flagship cryptocurrency.According to analysis of bitcoin's historic price patterns by economist Timothy Peterson on his X, formerly Twitter, account @nsquaredvalue, the currency will escape from its current lull in April, continuing to recover value through May to reach $126,000 by June 1.Why It MattersDespite hopes that the January 20 inauguration of President Donald Trump—who had campaigned on promises to enact industry-friendly policies once in office—would usher in a boom for cryptocurrency, bitcoin and other major tokens have lost significant value since the beginning of his administration.However, mounting fears over a U.S. recession have led some to speculate that bitcoin, like gold, could serve as a safe-haven asset should an extended economic downturn hit the country in the near-future. Others, meanwhile, believe a recession could put further downward pressure on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.What To KnowAccording to Peterson on X, his price forecast is based on bitcoin's historical bull runs having taken place in April and October.Bitcoin gained around 12 percent in October 2024, before undergoing an unprecedented postelection rally to reach an all-time high of $109,115 on January 20, per CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $83,500, having fallen more than 23 percent since the inauguration. Last week, the token fell below $80,000 for the first time since November.

Stablecoins are a type of digital asset designed to hold a constant value, typically with a peg to a fiat currency. Abu Dhabi launched the MGX investment firm last year with a focus on AI technology. In September, MGX partnered with the likes of BlackRockand Microsoft to launch a more than $30 billion AI fund, but it had yet to invest in the cryptocurrency industry and blockchain sectors. “MGX’s investment in Binance reflects our commitment to advancing blockchain’s transformative potential for digital finance,” Ahmed Yahia, managing director and CEO at MGX, said in a statement.The press release added that “by partnering with the leading industry player, MGX aims to enable innovation at the intersection of AI, blockchain technology and finance.”",

Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, has grown its Middle East footprint as it faced regulatory hurdles and enforcement measures in other jurisdictions in recent years, According to the press release, Binance employs approximately 1,000 of its roughly 5,000 global workforce in the UAE. It adds that it now boasts over 260 million registered users and has surpassed $100 trillion in cumulative trading volume. Binance CEO Richard Teng is scheduled to take part in a panel session at CNBC’s CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore at 2:40 p.m. local time (2:40 a.m. ET) on Thursday."

It was the least Trump could do after Musk spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to get him elected, according to FEC reports, and plans to pour $100 million more into Trump’s political operation, according to the New York Times.Musk and Trump’s mutual endorsements now taint Tesla in the eyes of many Americans — as does the fact that Trump has let Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency cronies run wild with cuts across the federal government and little transparency about what they’re doing.",

Trump Jr. said he has turned his back on opportunities where he doesn’t like the politics.“I’ve turned down major deals where the ethoses don’t align…There are people who have become MAGA more recently – and I don’t know they actually believe,” Trump Jr., told Bloomberg, which reported that since Inauguration Day, the firm has raised $500 million. Bloomberg reported that 1789 Capital will market itself to public pension plans in red states.1789 Capital describes itself as advocating an EIG investment strategy, short for entrepreneurship, investment and growth.It’s a play on ESG investing, which aims to prioritize investing in companies that care about the environment, social justice and open corporate governance. A conservative judge in Texas recently ruled against 26 red states and in favor of a Biden-era rule that allowed public pension plans to choose such a socially conscious investing strategy.Musk’s evolution from California-based liberal concerned about climate change to Texas-based libertarian coughing up serious coin for Trump and quietly slashing federal regulations tracks with a change in Tesla’s brand.A Columbia Business School study compares the politics and brand affinity of people according to their social media habits. In February of 2017, before Musk’s transformation, the study found Tesla to be more associated with people who followed Democrats on social media. By 2022, after he had moved Tesla and SpaceX to Texas as a form of protest against California, but before he had gone all in for Trump, the situation was reversed and Tesla was more associated with people who followed Republicans. It stands to reason that the transformation of Musk’s X to an echo chamber for conservatives has further impacted the Tesla brand."

The arrest shows that while the Trump administration has eased up pressure on Russia in some areas, such as offensive cyber operations, the Justice Department is still aggressively pursuing accused criminals with a connection to Russia.Besciokov had been living in Russia, according to the Justice Department. It is unclear why Besciokov traveled to India.Police in the southwest Indian state of Kerala arrested Besciokov this week, India’s Central Bureau of Investigation said in a statement that referred to Besciokov as a “fugitive.”",

Besciokov was in charge of keeping Garantex online and running its infrastructure, while Mira Serda was the exchange’s co-founder and “chief commercial officer,” according to the Justice Department.The Besciokov case is an example of how putting accused money launderers in handcuffs is the surest way to disrupt their activity. The US Treasury Department sanctioned Garantex in 2022. In response, Besciokov and others “redesigned Garantex’s operations” to evade sanctions and dupe US businesses into working with Garantex, according to the Justice Department. The exchange processed $96 billion in transactions between 2015 and 2019, according to the indictment."

    "content1": "In a court filing earlier this month, U.S. federal agents confirmed that a series of high-profile cyberheists, including a $150 million cryptocurrency theft, are linked to the 2022 breach of password manager service LastPass. The heists involved cracking master passwords stolen from LastPass, which allowed thieves to access sensitive information, including cryptocurrency seed phrases stored in the Secure Notes section of victims' accounts, according to KrebsonSecurity, which has been tracking these incidents since September 2023.The $150 million heist, which occurred on January 30, 2024, is believed to have targeted Chris Larsen, co-founder of the cryptocurrency platform Ripple, according to blockchain security researcher ZachXBT. Federal prosecutors in northern California have seized approximately $24 million in cryptocurrencies related to this theft.According to the seizure document, the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI believe the attackers used stolen data from LastPass to access victims' accounts without authorization. This pattern is consistent with similar six-figure crypto heists, where victims had stored their cryptocurrency seed phrases in LastPass before the 2022 breaches.Krebs says that security researchers Nick Bax and Taylor Monahan have been working with dozens of victims and found none experienced typical precursor attacks, such as email or mobile phone account compromises, or SIM-swapping attacks. Instead, all victims had stored their cryptocurrency seed phrases in LastPass's Secure Notes before the breaches. The heists followed a similar pattern of rapidly moving stolen funds to numerous drop accounts scattered across various cryptocurrency exchanges.",

This assessment changed on November 30, 2022, when LastPass disclosed that criminal hackers had compromised encrypted copies of some password vaults and other personal information using data stolen in the August breach."

(NYSE:PLYM), a company specializing in the acquisition and management of industrial properties, has reported significant leasing activity for the first quarter of 2025. The company announced that leases commencing in the first quarter, which ended March 31, 2025, covered an aggregate of 2,437,267 square feet. This included 1,540,756 square feet of renewal leases and 896,511 square feet of new leases. The $671 million market cap REIT currently trades at attractive valuations according to InvestingPro analysis, with a P/E ratio of 5.56x and offering a substantial 6.52% dividend yield.The rental rates for these leases showed a marked increase, with a 16.2% rise on a cash basis for all leases excluding a major St. Louis lease. Renewal leases alone saw a 15.0% increase, while new leases jumped 22.1%. However, when including the St. Louis lease, the overall rental rate increase was 9.6%, and new leases specifically saw a modest 0.9% increase.Same store occupancy as of March 31, 2025, stood at 94.7%, with the total portfolio occupancy at 94.3%. This reflects a positive impact from the St. Louis lease and leasing activities in Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Atlanta, offset by a net negative impact from other leasing activities during the quarter.For the remainder of 2025, Plymouth has executed leases totaling 4,652,684 square feet, which represents 56.3% of the total expirations for the year. These include 3,731,230 square feet of renewal leases and 921,454 square feet of new leases.In terms of acquisition activity, Plymouth closed on six industrial buildings totaling 801,161 square feet for $65.1 million during the first quarter. These fully leased properties have a weighted average initial estimated net operating income (NOI) yield of 6.8% and a weighted average remaining lease term of 4.4 years. The company maintains a strong operational efficiency with a gross profit margin of 68.06%, though InvestingPro data indicates its current ratio of 0.81 suggests tight liquidity management.",

The company’s earnings per share (EPS) came in at $3.24, significantly surpassing the forecast of $0.0314, yet its revenue of $47.57 million fell short of the anticipated $50.76 million. Additionally, JMP Securities adjusted Plymouth’s price target to $24 from a previous $27, maintaining a Market Outperform rating. This adjustment reflects a cautious view due to tenant turnover and increased competition in investment sales markets. Meanwhile, Plymouth Industrial REIT appointed Robert O. Stephenson, Omega Healthcare’s CFO, to its Board of Directors, enhancing its governance with his extensive REIT sector experience. Furthermore, JMP Securities analysts highlighted Plymouth’s strategic market exposure and strong dividend yield, noting that the stock trades at a lower multiple compared to industry averages.

          "content1": "If you’re interested in diversifying your portfolio through real estate investing, but aren’t ready to take the plunge into landlordship, it may be time to look into REITs. According to Investopedia, real estate investing trusts (REITs) are companies that own, operate, or finance income-producing real estate across a wide range of property sectors. The outlet explains that these investments allow you to earn income from real estate without having to buy, manage, or finance properties themselves.  Sounds great, right? You’re not the only one that thinks that. Data from real estate data hub Nareit, 145 million Americans are invested in REIT stocks, as of 2020. Black women are cashing in on the movement. On TikTok, more than 22M videos about Black women in stocks, and content creators are sharing their insight on REITs for followers. Ashley M. Fox, former Wall Street analyst and founder of personal finance platform Empify says REITs changed her outlook on investing. ",

          "content1": "Because of current laws, Real Estate Investment Trusts are popular among retirees. One reason is they're required by law to pay out most of their taxable income in the form of dividends.Moreover, if you're a retiree, this could be used to supplement your income in your later years. As a retiree, you often need less and look for stability in your life.REITs regularly provide this, as many offer low to mid-single digit growth. And while they may not blow your top off with astronomical capital appreciation, they do provide steady & reliable streams of income.That's why I think these two under-the-radar REITs can do just that. They are not as popular as some of their peers, but have solid fundamentals and are likely to continue paying dividends while providing some level of growth. In this article, I discuss two lesser-known REITs income-oriented investors should know.",

Their office properties were similar to BFS' at 86% leased. Some of their notable tenants include Alphabet (GOOG), Autodesk (ADSK), Smartsheet (SMAR), and Lowe's (LOW).And like their peer Saul Centers, American Assets Trust's financials have also been resilient with solid growth the past 5 years. Unlike AAT, however, the latter was forced to cut its dividend during COVID-19 from $0.30 to $0.20 for a single quarter before getting back on the path to growth.Revenue over that same period grew from $367 million to $441.1 million. 2024 revenue estimates are $445.57 million, a solid growth rate of 21.4%."          },

But some market watchers think things could be about to turn around. \"I think it would be an opportune time to invest in real estate especially given that we are forecasting interest rates to decline over the next 12 months,\" according to Kevin Brown, senior equities analyst at financial services firm Morningstar. He suggests that investors look to have 10% of their portfolio exposed to \"real estate in some form, as a good rule of thumb.\" \"That exposure can come from REITs [real estate invest",

But REITs present a great and easy opportunity to the asset class which is otherwise difficult to invest in. With rate cuts anticipated, I expect REITs to outperform the broader U.S. market this year,\" Brown told CNBC Pro on Feb. 14. Rick Romano, Head of Global Real Estate Securities at PGIM Real Estate, agrees, saying that REITs offer investors \"a unique and fantastic\" opportunity to invest across geographies and segments right now. Commercial property pick One segment Brown likes is commercial properties occupied by tenants such as drugstores, retailers, food outlets and gas stations. The diversity — and the fact that tenants are selling necessities — mean they are not overly sensitive to economic conditions and can post gains even if a recession hits, Brown said, naming Realty Income as a REIT to consider. Realty Incomes says its portfolio includes over 13,000 commercial properties with a 98.8% occupancy rate. \"Realty Income has a triple net lease structure, which means their tenants are responsible for everything, [namely] all expenses that can be generated by the property. They are also a conservative tenant with low rents relative to the revenues generated by tenants so there's a very low risk of it not receiving rent,\" Brown said. He also flagged that the company is part of the S & P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index and has raised its dividend payout for 25 consecutive years. The REIT has a 5-year average dividend yield of 4.5% and is trading at around a 10% discount to net asset value — a key measure of a REIT's value — according to FactSet data. Boom in data centers Aside from commercial spaces, PGIM's Romano sees opportunities in data centers. He expects a shortage of supply in 2023-2024, \"in conjunction with this very severe demand spike due to AI right now.\" \"It's an area that we see some of the best growth rates within the real estate space,\" he added. Among the REITs with an exposure to data centers that Romano's PGIM Global Real Estate Fund is invested in are Prologis (8.1% of the fund as of Dec. 2023) and Equinix (5.3% of the fund). Prologis — which owns almost 800 properties globally, including a number of data centers — is trading at a premium of around 4% to net asset value. Equinix, with 250 data centers, is trading at a premium of around 17% according to FactSet data. Senior housing buys? Morningstar's Brown highlighted the senior housing market as a segment to watch, particularly in the U.S. as the baby boomer generation ages. \"We're going to have very high demand growth,\" he said, highlighting that the Covid pandemic reduced building activity and, as such, supply is not keeping up with occupancy levels. REITs he likes include Ventas — which has over 1,400 properties including senior housing facilities and outpatient medical buildings across the U.S., U.K and Canada — as well as Welltower , which has exposure to senior housing, outpatient care facilities and care spaces. \"Ventas, in particular, is trading at a very big discount,\" Brown noted. \"Both names are buys into the bigger senior housing theme.\" Ventas is trading at discount of around 3% to its net asset value, according to FactSet, while Welltower is trading at premium of around 55%.More In Pro Stock PicksWhat Josh Brown was buying and selling during the market's 2-day Trump routSean ConlonCEOs think Trump's tariff plan is a 'huge mistake,' says Altimeter's Brad GerstnerJesse PoundJosh Brown says tariffs could tip stocks into a bear market.

Many groups on Wall Street offer these tax-friendly funds to retail investors. KKR's real estate business is one of the big players in the REIT game. The private equity firm manages multiple REIT funds. The KKR Real Estate Select Trust, which currently manages $1.5 billion in assets, paid a dividend of 5.4% to its investors in July 2023. But the benefits extend beyond returns. \"When you look at the after tax equivalent of that yield, it is very compelling.\" said Billy Butcher, CEO of KKR's global real estate business. \"The depreciation from our properties has covered 100% of the income generated by our properties, and there's no tax on that dividend,\" he said in an interview with CNBC.Larger funds sometimes contain a diversified pool of assets. Categories may include office, student housing, casino, timberlands, radio and cell towers, server farms, self-storage properties, billboards, and much more.\"Back in the 1960s, there were three or four different types [of REITs], said Sher Hafeez, a managing director at Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate services firm. \"Now, I can count at least 20 different types.\"Top performing REIT sub-sectors in recent years include data centers, self-storage properties, residential housing and tower REITs. Residential housing delivered a return of 16% from 2010 to 2020, according to a S&P Global Investments report.The investor-friendly tax rules can also increase the pace of large-scale development. \"Having REITs there as a potential exit helps the market, and helps the availability of financing,\" said Michael Pestronk, CEO and co-founder of Post Brothers, a Philadelphia-based housing developer. Some funds like Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent were founded in the yearslong slowdown in U.S. home construction. At the time, REITs bought and managed commercial-scale properties, which could include products like master-planned communities or traditional apartment complexes.In recent years, publicly traded trusts have targeted single-family rental market, and today, these REITs have grown tremendously — enough to build new neighborhoods in their entirety.

Home Stocks City Office REIT-stock News for City Office REIT 3 Low-Priced REITs Making Big Moves 3 Low-Priced REITs Making Big Moves Benzinga Jun. 9, 2023, 04:09 PM Several low-priced real estate investment trusts (REITs) made huge moves higher this week, and many are in the office or healthcare subsectors. Investors know that low-priced stocks can be volatile, and it’s as easy to lose as it is to gain a lot in the short term. These stocks are not for conservative investors or for people on a fixed income who cannot afford to take large risks with their capital. But abrupt new moves in a low-priced stock often portend even more future gains to come. If an investor is patient and perhaps waits for a price pullback off a spike, it is possible to do quite well on these trades. Take a look at three low-priced REITs that have blasted higher on increasing volume this week. Don't miss: The Company That Built Elon Musk's Tiny Home Is Partnering With This REIT To Solve The Affordable Housing Crisis And Provide A Unique Investment Opportunity Diversified Healthcare Trust (NASDAQ:DHC) is a Newton, Massachusetts-based healthcare REIT that owns 376 healthcare-related properties of approximately $7.1 billion across 36 states and Washington, D.C. In addition to over 100 life science and medical offices, Diversified Healthcare Trust also has 27,389 senior living community units in its portfolio. In April, Office Properties Income Trust (NASDAQ:OPI) announced it was acquiring Diversified Healthcare Trust in an all-share transaction. It seemed like a done deal because in May, Office Properties Income Trust began to implement the financing needed to complete the transaction. On June 2, Diversified Healthcare Director Adam D. Portnoy purchased a total of 5,566,644 shares at an average price of $1.77 per share, for a total of $9.81 million. However, on June 5, investment adviser firm Flat Footed LLC, a top shareholder with about 8% of Diversified Healthcare Trust, reiterated its intent to vote against the proposed merger. Flat Footed sent a letter to the Diversified Healthcare board asking for clarification of details of the merger — specifically why the board is willing to let Diversified Healthcare go for $1.13 per share after rejecting an all-cash $4 per share bid in 2022. The letter also asked why Portnoy was purchasing Diversified Healthcare stock at $1.77, well above the merger price. Diversified Healthcare shares rose quickly after this was announced and are up 37.28% over the past three days. Its most recent closing price was $2.32. Uniti Group Inc. (NASDAQ:UNIT) is a Little Rock, Arkansas-based specialty REIT that acquires and constructs mission-critical communications infrastructure in the form of fiber optics, copper and coaxial broadband networks. Uniti Group owns and operates 137,000 fiber route miles covering 275,000 commercial buildings, with most of its network in the Eastern and Midwestern portions of the U.S. It’s one of the 10 largest fiber prov",

          "content2": "iders in the U.S. today, and its fiber optic leasing generates about 70% of its total revenue. Analysts have been tepid on Uniti Group recently. Morgan Stanley analyst Simon Flannery maintained an Underweight rating on Uniti Group on June 1, while lowering the price target from $7 to $6. On May 30, RBC Capital Markets analyst Bora Lee maintained a Sector Perform rating on Uniti Group but lowered the price target from $7 to $5. But over three days this week, and without any news, Uniti Group has risen 11.86%. On Tuesday, it was 6.3% higher in the premarket and finished up 4.4% for the day. Its most recent closing price was $4.34. Unity Group President and CEO Kenny Gunderman purchased 225,000 shares of Uniti Group at an average price of $4.37 in the first week of March, amounting to $983,250. Perhaps investors are feeling more confident that the $0.15 per share quarterly dividend, or $0.60 annual per share that yields 13.82%, will remain intact. The next ex-dividend date is June 15. City Office REIT Inc. (NYSE:CIO) is a Dallas-based office REIT that owns 58 buildings totaling 6 million square feet. The REIT is focused on the Sun Belt region, West Coast and select areas in Florida. On May 30, RBC Capital analyst Michael Carroll maintained a Sector Perform rating on City Office REIT but was more negative in lowering the price target from $10 to $7. Nevertheless, City Office REIT is one of several office REITs that have seen huge price increases this week in a subsector that has had very little love from Wall Street for a long time. City Office REIT is up 9.7% this week. Other low-priced office REITs picking up big gains this week are Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE:BDN), up 10.71%, and Hudson Pacific Properties Inc. (NYSE:HPP), up 9.66% in three days. Office stocks were crushed between February and the end of May but have shown recent resiliency.
